# ILI9341Driver

A [nanoframework](https://nanoframework.net/) driver for ili9341-based displays interfaced using SPI. 

An extended port port of [veccsolutions' Netduino drivers](https://github.com/veccsolutions/Vecc.Netduino.Drivers.Ili9341), with inspiration taken from [Adafruit's Arduino drivers](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341).

This driver is 100% managed code, which makes it slow. However, being managed means that it should be fully platform-agnostic (although it has currently only been tested on an Adafruit HUZZAH32 ESP32-based board).
